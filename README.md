ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alfonso-13, a passionate Full-Stack Developer with over 9 years of experience. I began my career in 2014 with VB.NET and C#. In 2018, I had the opportunity to lead 6 development teams to successfully release a new product for a banking insurance division. Since 2019, I've continued to grow as a Full-Stack Developer, constantly expanding my skill set by learning new languages and frameworks to meet the evolving demands of the projects I work on. Currently, I'm focused on .NET Core and React.js, always seeking to improve and stay updated in the tech world.
